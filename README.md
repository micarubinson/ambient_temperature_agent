# ambient_temperature_agent

This POC introduces an agent-based system that takes a machine ID and returns the ambient temperature at the machine's physical location. It does so by combining metadata extraction, LLM-based inference, and a weather API lookup. Originally motivated by false alarms during unexpected heatwaves.
